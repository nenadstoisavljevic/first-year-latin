# Collar and Daniell's First Year Latin

This is a repository of my translations and exercises for the `Collar and Daniell's First Year Latin` mini-textbook. Many Latin mini-textbooks that came out around 100 or so years ago don't in fact have answer keys. If you are teaching yourself Latin, this can be immensely frustrating since you don't know whether you are following the proper grammatical rules or not. Ergo, I've decided to compile all my answers to the various exercises, etc. so that learning Latin could become easier.

There is nothing notably special about this Latin mini-textbook, it just so happens to be the one I've found when I decided to learn Latin. Keep in mind, there are many versions of this book out there, this particular version is `Collar and Daniell's First Year Latin (1901)`. You might be lucky enough to acquire a physical copy of this mini-textbook in a second-hand bookstore. If not, then you could download a PDF version of it on your machine from [here](https://nenadstoisavljevic.xyz/files/cdfyl.pdf) or just run this short command:

```
curl -LO nenadstoisavljevic.xyz/files/cdfyl.pdf
